## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this project is to visualize the impact COVID-19 has had on the world, in terms of cases, deaths, and vaccionations. Although many of us were personally impacted, many live with the false idea that it never happened or that it was fake. The goal is to show with facts the effects of the pandemic.

## 2. Data

The source for the data used in this project is [Our World in Data - Coronavirus (COVID-19) Deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The database had a lot of data that I was not going to use, so I cleaned it up in Excel and split it into two databases.
