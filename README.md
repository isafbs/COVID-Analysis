## ✨ 1. Introduction
HTML5 works together with CSS3 to create websites that we use in our day to day. Including this very website, where you are seeing this, is built with HTML and CSS.

In this project, with the knowledge of HTML and CSS, I recreated the Google home page.

## ✨ 2. What I built

In this project I focused on building a recreation of the Google home page. It contains the following sections:
* Header: Section that contains a profile picture, icons, and a menu with links
* Main: Section that contains central elements for the home page (logo, search bar, buttons, and icons)
* Footer: Section that includes links at the end of the home page

## ✨ 3. Objective
The main objective of this project was to learn how to use HTML5 and CSS3 tags.
